Record Review:

10/05/2024, Motor Vehicle Accident Report - Two-vehicle collision occurred at 02:35 PM on Avocado Avenue, Miami, FL. The patient's vehicle was struck on the left side by another vehicle switching lanes near the Plaza Street intersection.

10/06/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Gregory Mazzotta, D.C. - Initial evaluation for 54-year-old male presenting with acute cervical pain, acute thoracic pain, and headache following motor vehicle accident. Physical examination revealed positive orthopedic tests including Compression, Jackson's, Distraction, Shoulder Depression, and Kemp's (Thoracic). Cervical and thoracic range of motion was decreased with pain. Palpable spasm and trigger points were evident in the cervical and thoracic spines. Patient measured 5'6" tall, 165 lbs, with normal vital signs. Initial diagnosis included cervicalgia, thoracic pain, headache, myalgia, and myospasm.

10/08/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Gregory Mazzotta, D.C. - Follow-up visit with continued cervical and thoracic pain. Range of motion remained painful and restricted in all planes for both cervical and thoracic regions. Treatment included chiropractic manipulative therapy, massage, trigger point therapy, therapeutic exercises, hot/cold packs, electrical muscle stimulation, ultrasound, and shockwave therapy.

10/10/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Gregory Mazzotta, D.C. - Follow-up visit with persistent cervical and thoracic pain and continued range of motion restrictions. Same multimodal treatment approach continued.

10/11/2024, Central Magnetic Imaging - South, ordered by Gregory Mazzotta, D.C. - MRI cervical spine for neck pain status post motor vehicle accident revealed marked straightening of normal cervical lordosis consistent with marked torticollis/cervical strain. Multiple disc herniations identified: 1mm broad-based right paracentral disc herniation at C3-C4, 2mm broad-based central/right paracentral disc herniation at C4-C5, 3mm broad-based left paracentral disc herniation contacting the anterior surface of the spinal cord at C5-C6, and 2mm broad-based left posterolateral disc herniation at C6-C7. Radiologist opined that findings may be related to muscle spasm from ligamentous injury and/or disc injury.

10/14/2024, OrthoMiami, Caesar E. Ceballos, MD - Initial orthopedic evaluation via telemedicine for neck pain and headache. Patient reported pain level of 5/10. Examination revealed bilateral trapezius tenderness and muscle spasms, stiffness with limited range of motion in all planes, and pain at terminal ranges. Spurling's test was negative bilaterally. Neurological examination showed bilateral upper and lower extremities were neurovascularly intact. Dr. Ceballos recommended conservative management and chiropractic modalities. He opined that the patient suffered an emergency medical condition as a direct result of the motor vehicle accident per Florida Statute 766.38(16).

10/15/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Gregory Mazzotta, D.C. - Nerve conduction study revealed bilateral compression of ulnar nerves at elbows, worse on the left. Motor nerve conduction was normal for both median and ulnar nerves distally. Velocity at elbow was decreased in both ulnar nerves (left greater than right). Sensory testing showed delay in both radial nerves (right greater than left). EMG was recommended to rule out cervical radiculopathies with repeat study in 3 months.

11/01/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Mark Silverman, D.C. - Daily treatment note documenting widespread complaints including headache, neck pain, bilateral upper extremity symptoms (shoulders, arms, elbows, forearms, wrists, hands, fingers), and bilateral lower extremity symptoms (hips, thighs, hamstrings, knees, shins, calves, ankles, feet, legs, toes). Examination showed positive bilateral Spurling's test and continued range of motion restrictions with pain in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Palpation revealed tenderness and spasm in cervical region and trigger points in thoracic region. Activities of daily living remained limited. Multimodal treatment continued including chiropractic manipulation, massage, trigger point therapy, therapeutic exercises, modalities, and mechanical traction.

11/04/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Mark Silverman, D.C. - Similar presentation with widespread pain complaints and continued objective findings of range of motion restrictions and soft tissue abnormalities. Treatment plan remained consistent.

12/05/2024, Alpha Med & Rehab South Miami, Giancarlo Perez - Office visit for neck pain radiating to bilateral shoulders (worse on left) and thoracic spine, rated 6/10 intensity. Physical examination revealed 25% decreased range of motion in all planes with pain at extremes. Spurling's test was negative on right, positive on left. Hoffman's test was negative bilaterally. Motor strength was 5/5 bilaterally in C5-T1 distribution except for 4/5 left biceps strength. Sensation remained intact to light touch. Tenderness and spasm were present on palpation. Imaging review confirmed C5-C6 disc herniation effacing the central thecal sac, abutting the ventral surface of the spinal cord, and resulting in bilateral foraminal stenosis. Dr. Perez opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the patient's current symptomatology and cervical pathology were directly attributed to the injury of 10/05/2024, given no prior history of neck pain. Treatment plan included referral to interventional pain management for cervical epidural steroid injection, with potential need for C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion if injection fails.

02/11/2025, Alpha Med & Rehab Miami/Kendall, Abel Murillo, MD - Pain management evaluation for cervical spine pain described as aching and sore, rated 5/10 on visual analog scale. Pain was alleviated by rest and medications but aggravated by movement, with functional limitations in daily activities. Physical examination showed 25% decreased range of motion in all planes with pain at extremes, along with tenderness and spasm on palpation. Neurological testing revealed intact sensation at C4-T1 levels bilaterally and normal reflexes at C5-C7 levels. Vital signs were stable with blood pressure 122/90 mmHg, pulse 88 bpm, temperature 95.2¬∞F, oxygen saturation 99%, respiratory rate 19 bpm, and height 69 inches. After reviewing cervical MRI, Dr. Murillo recommended cervical epidural steroid injection (CESI). He performed a C6-C7 cervical epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance for bilateral cervical radiculitis and cervicalgia secondary to herniated disc.

02/25/2025, Alpha Med & Rehab South Miami, Ninedty Cordova Muniz, APRN/Aldrich Mendoza, MD - Preoperative medical evaluation and clearance for planned neck surgery. Patient reported pain level of 5/10. Physical examination revealed supple neck with no masses, normal thyroid, and no cervical lymphadenopathy. Neurological examination showed cranial nerves 2-12 grossly intact, motor strengths grossly intact bilaterally, intact sensation, negative Romberg's test, normal gait, and deep tendon reflexes 2+/4 bilaterally. Diagnostic studies included chest X-ray on 02/14/2025 showing no acute pathology, complete blood count/comprehensive metabolic panel/coagulation studies/urinalysis on 02/25/2025 with no significant abnormalities, and EKG showing normal sinus rhythm at 87 bpm. The patient was deemed medically stable and at low risk for surgery, cleared to proceed after cardiologist clearance.

Of note, there are discrepancies in the motor vehicle accident date, with some records indicating 10/05/2024, others 10/06/2024, and one record stating 10/07/2024. The accident mechanism is consistently described as a side-impact collision. Patient demographics remain consistent as a 54-year-old male, though height measurements vary slightly (5'6" versus 69 inches). The patient's condition progressed from initial soft tissue injuries to documented disc herniations with neurological involvement, ultimately requiring interventional pain management and surgical consideration.
