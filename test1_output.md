## RECORD REVIEW

**October 6, 2024 - Initial Evaluation (Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center)**
Dr. Gregory Mazzotta, D.C. conducted the initial evaluation of a 54-year-old male patient following a motor vehicle accident on October 7, 2024. The patient reported being the driver when his vehicle was struck on the left side by another vehicle switching lanes. He initially went home to rest but persistent symptoms prompted seeking medical attention.

Initial complaints included: acute cervical pain, acute thoracic pain, and headache. Physical examination revealed positive orthopedic tests including Compression+, Jackson's+, Distraction+, Shoulder Depression+, and Kemp's (Thoracic)+. Range of motion was decreased with pain in both cervical and thoracic spine regions. Initial diagnoses included cervicalgia, thoracic pain, headache, myalgia, myospasm, and classification as "Driver."

Treatment plan consisted of initial two-week program with four visits per week for two weeks, followed by re-evaluation within 3 weeks. Treatment modalities included specific adjustive procedures, EMS, hot/cold packs, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise, trigger point therapy, and shockwave therapy.

**October 7, 2024 - Daily Treatment Note**
Patient continued with comprehensive treatment including C.M.T (chiropractic manipulative therapy), massage, trigger point therapy, therapeutic exercises, hot/cold packs, ultrasound, and shockwave therapy. Treatment addressed cervical and thoracic spine regions.

**October 8, 2024 - Daily Treatment Note**
Similar comprehensive treatment protocol continued with focus on cervical spine T5-T0, thoracic T5-T0, and lumbar regions.

**October 10, 2024 - Daily Treatment Note**
Treatment progression continued with cervical pain rated 10/10 and thoracic pain 10/10. Patient reported understanding of readiness in responding to therapy. Assessment noted expected improvement with continued care.

**October 11, 2024 - MRI Cervical Spine (Central Magnetic Imaging)**
MRI performed without contrast revealed multiple significant findings:
- Marked straightening of normal cervical lordosis consistent with torticollis/cervical strain
- C3-C4: 1mm broad-based right paracentral disc herniation with thecal sac and partial disc desiccation
- C4-C5: 2mm broad-based central/right paracentral disc herniation with thecal sac and partial disc desiccation
- C5-C6: 3mm broad-based left paracentral disc herniation with thecal sac compression and edematous vertebral endplate changes appearing acute or subacute
- C6-C7: 2mm broad-based left posterolateral disc herniation with thecal sac and partial disc desiccation
- Spondylotic changes at multiple levels

**October 11, 2024 - Films Interpretation**
X-ray findings showed normal disc heights but decreased curve. Jackson's angle measurements indicated straightening of lordotic curve. Thoracic and lumbar findings noted moderate degenerative changes and scoliosis.

**October 14, 2024 - OrthoMiami Medical Evaluation**
Dr. Cesar E. Ceballos, M.D. conducted comprehensive orthopedic evaluation. Patient reported constant stabbing pain rated 5/10. Physical examination revealed:
- Stiffness throughout range of motion in all planes
- Self-palpation demonstrating right and left paraspinal muscle tenderness
- Right trapezius tenderness and muscle spasms
- Left trapezius tenderness and muscle spasms
- Negative Spurling's test bilaterally

Dr. Ceballos provided detailed patient counseling regarding cervicalgia and muscle spasm management. Treatment plan included conservative management with chiropractic modalities. The physician's impression included cervicalgia, cervical spine muscle spasms, and an emergency medical condition determination was made pursuant to Florida Statute 766.38(16).

**October 14, 2024 - Orders and Prescriptions**
Physical therapy orders issued for cervical spine with diagnoses of cervicalgia (M54.2), other muscle spasm (M62.838), and sprain of ligaments of cervical spine (S13.4XXA). Treatment frequency recommended at 3-4 times per week for 4-6 weeks.

**October 15, 2024 - Nerve Conduction Studies**
Dr. Sonia Tolgyesi, M.D. (Neurology) conducted comprehensive nerve conduction velocity studies revealing:

Motor findings:
- Normal distal latency for median and ulnar nerves bilaterally
- Decreased NCV-Elbow bilaterally for ulnar nerves (Lt>Rt)
- Normal amplitude for both ulnar and median nerves

Sensory findings:
- Delay in both radial nerves (Rt>Lt)
- Borderline right radial, normal left radial
- Both ulnar and median nerves normal
- Decreased left ulnar amplitude

Conclusion: Bilateral compression of ulnar nerves at elbows, worse on the left. EMG recommended to rule out cervical radiculopathies with follow-up in 3 months.

**October 15, 2024 - NCV Report Details**
Detailed waveform analysis provided showing specific latencies, velocities, and amplitudes for all tested nerves. F-wave studies showed increased right ulnar and normal bilateral median F-waves.

Comprehensive daily treatment continued throughout the month including:
- Chiropractic manipulative therapy (C.M.T)
- Massage therapy
- Trigger point therapy
- Therapeutic exercises
- Hot/cold pack applications
- Ultrasound therapy
- Shockwave therapy
- Mechanical traction

Pain levels consistently reported at 10/10 for both cervical and thoracic regions through October 29, 2024. Patient assessment notes indicated expected improvement with slower than expected progress.

**October 30, 2024 - Treatment Script**
Formal treatment prescription issued for cervical and thoracic regions including hot pack, electrical muscle stimulation, ultrasound, trigger point therapy, adjustments, and therapeutic exercises. Treatment frequency prescribed as 3 times per week in Phase 2: Sub-acute corrective care.

**October 30, 2024 - Progress Note**
Comprehensive orthopedic and neurological assessment performed. Patient pain rated 6/10. Multiple positive orthopedic tests documented including compression, Jackson's, distraction, and others. Treatment goals focused on symptom reduction and functional capacity improvement.
