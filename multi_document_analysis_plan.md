# Multi-Document Medical Analysis System Plan

## Problem Statement
Need to process multiple medical documents and generate one cohesive summary for legal analysis.

## Approach Analysis

### Option 1: Separate Markdown Files → Combined Analysis
**Process:** PDF → Individual Analysis → Markdown File → Combine All Markdowns → Final Summary

**Pros:**
- Preserves individual document structure and formatting
- Easy to review individual analyses
- Can reprocess/update individual documents without affecting others
- Good audit trail - you can see what came from which document
- Markdown maintains formatting for tables, lists, headers

**Cons:**
- Two-step process increases API calls/costs
- Risk of hitting token limits when combining many large analyses
- Potential loss of cross-document connections in first pass

### Option 2: Direct Text Extraction → Combined Analysis
**Process:** Multiple PDFs → Extract Text → Single Combined Prompt → One Analysis

**Pros:**
- Single API call = lower cost
- AI can see connections across all documents simultaneously
- More cohesive analysis from the start
- Better for identifying contradictions/patterns across documents

**Cons:**
- Loses formatting/structure information
- Harder to trace findings back to source documents
- Risk of hitting token limits with many large documents
- Less granular control over individual document processing

### Option 3: Hybrid Structured Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Process:** PDF → Structured JSON Extraction → Combine JSON → Final Narrative

**Why this is best:**
- Extract key data points into structured format (JSON) from each PDF
- Structured data is more compact than full markdown
- Can easily combine multiple JSON files
- Final step generates cohesive narrative from structured data
- Maintains traceability (each data point tagged with source document)
- Easier to build features like filtering, searching, data visualization

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Individual Document Processing
- Modify current script to extract structured JSON data instead of markdown
- Create JSON schema for medical data extraction with fields like:
```json
{
  "document_id": "doc1",
  "incident_date": "2024-10-07",
  "providers": [...],
  "diagnoses": [...],
  "treatments": [...],
  "billing": [...],
  "timeline": [...]
}
```
- Include document metadata and source tracking

### Phase 2: Data Aggregation System
- Build script to combine multiple JSON files
- Implement conflict detection between documents
- Create unified timeline generation across all documents

### Phase 3: Final Report Generator
- Takes combined JSON data as input
- Generates cohesive legal summary
- Outputs to markdown with source attribution
- Include cross-references between documents

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Scalable:** Easy to add more documents
- **Cost-effective:** Structured data uses fewer tokens
- **Maintainable:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Traceable:** Know which document contributed which information
- **Flexible:** Can generate different types of reports from same data

## Implementation Steps
1. **Modify current script to extract structured JSON data**
2. **Build document aggregation system**
3. **Create final report generator**

This structured approach will be more scalable, cost-effective, and maintainable than processing raw text or combining markdown files.
