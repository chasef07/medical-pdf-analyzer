Both vehicles were estimated to have $1,000 in damage and were removed by their owners. Photos of John Doe’s vehicle shows minor damage to the driver’s side.

10/06/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center, Gregory Mazzotta, DC, Initial Evaluation, report states John Doe was hit on the left side on 10/07/2024 (actually 10/05/2024) by another car switching lanes. He went home and rested, however had persistent pain and decided to seek medical attention the next day. His initial complaints were acute cervical pain, acute thoracic pain, and headache which are constant and affecting his ADLs and sleep. Patient denied prior MVA in report.

Physical exam consisted of positive compression, positive Jackson’s, positive distraction, positive shoulder depression, and positive Kemp’s (thoracic), as well as palpable spasm with restricted motion in cervical and thoracic spines. 
 
Initial diagnoses were cervicalgia, thoracic pain, headache, myalgia, myospasms, and treatment prescribed was 4 visits per week for 2 weeks, and re-evaluation within 3 weeks. The treatment recommended were adjustments of the spine, EMS, hot/cold packs, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise, trigger point, shockwave therapy.  

Of note, report incorrectly states Date of Accident as 10/07/2024. Additionally, no mention of +/- radiculopathy or any strength testing during initial exam.

MRI Cervical Spine revealed:

FINDINGS:
	•	The vertebral bodies are in normal anatomic alignment. Normal vertebral stature is maintained. There is marked straightening of the normal cervical lordosis.
	•	Normal marrow signal is demonstrated throughout the regional bones. The intervertebral disc spaces are fairly well-maintained.
	•	There are spondylotic changes at C3, C4, C5 and C5-C6, with edematous vertebral endplate changes at C5-C6 which appear acute or subacute.
	•	The cervicomedullary junction is normal in appearance without evidence of Chiari malformation.
	•	The cervical spinal cord demonstrates normal course and caliber, without evidence of signal abnormality.
	•	The level of C2-C3 is unremarkable.
	•	At the level of C3-C4 there is a 1mm broad-based right paracentral disc herniation demonstrated on axial image #24 and 25 with compression on the thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.
	•	At the level of C4-C5 there is a 2 mm broad-based central/right paracentral disc herniation demonstrated on axial images #44 and 45 with compression of the thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.
	•	At the level of C5-C6 there is a 3 mm broad-based left paracentral disc herniation contacting the anterior surface of the spinal cord itself demonstrated on axial image 11 with compression on thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.
	•	At the level of C6-C7 there is a 2 mm broad-based left posterolateral disc herniation demonstrated on axial image #26 with compression of the thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.
	•	The level of C7 – T1 is unremarkable.
	•	The facet joints are normal in appearance.

IMPRESSION:
	•	There is marked straightening of the normal cervical lordosis consistent with marked torticollis/cervical strain. Findings may be related to muscle spasm from ligamentous injury and/or disc injury.
	•	At the level of C3-C4 there is a 1mm broad-based right paracentral disc herniation demonstrated on axial image #24 and #25 with compression on the thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.
	•	At the level of C4-C5 there is a 2 mm broad-based central/right paracentral disc herniation demonstrated on axial images #44 and #45 with compression of the thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.
	•	At the level of C5-C6 there is a 3 m broad-based left paracentral disc herniation contacting the b anterior surface of the spinal cord itself demonstrated on axial image 11 with compression on thecal sac and partial disc desiccation. There are edematous vertebral endplate changes at this level which appear acute or subacute and may be a pain generator.
	•	At the level of C6-C7 there is a 2 mm broad-based left posterolateral disc herniation demonstrated on axial image #26 with compression of the thecal sac and partial disc desiccation.

10/14/2024, Ortho Miami, Dr. Cesar E. Cabellos, MD, via telemedicine for headaches, neck and mid back pain from a MVA where he was the restrained driver that was  T-boned. No airbags deployed and no emergency services were needed. He reported constant, stabbing pain 5/10 that does not wake him from sleep. He reported taking 2 days off of work due to the injury. Patient also reported that his injury has impacted daily activities as well as work duties. He reported no prior injuries. 

Physical Exam revealed bilateral trapezius spasms, tenderness to self-palpation, pain at terminal ranges of motion and that upper and lower extremities were neurovascularly intact 

He was diagnosed with cervicalgia, other muscle spasm, and sprain of ligaments of cervical spine. Treatment prescribed was physical therapy for cervical spine 3-4 times per week for 4-6 weeks. Counseling on diagnoses given. 

10/15/2024, Silverman Chiropractic & Rehabilitation, Sonia Tolgyesi, MD, Neurology
Nerve Conduction Upper Extremities revealed: 
Description of procedure: Both median and both ulnar nerves were tested for sensory and motor conduction, as well as F wave responses. Both radial nerves were tested for sensory conduction.

MOTOR:
Distal latency: Normal both median and normal both ulnar nerves. Motor-NCV: Normal both ulnar (distally) and normal both median nerves. NCV-Elbow: Decreased both ulnar nerves (Lt>Rt).
Amplitude: Normal both ulnar and normal both median nerves.

SENSORY:
Distal latency: Delay both radial (Rt>Lt), normal both median and normal both ulnar nerves. Sensory-NCV: Borderline right radial, normal left radial, both ulnar and both median nerves. Amplitude: Decreased left ulnar, normal right ulnar, both median and both radial nerves.
F-wave: Increased right ulnar, normal left ulnar and normal both median F-waves.

NCV findings: The NCV study shows that velocity at elbow (Lt>Rt) is decreased in both ulnar nerves on motor studies. On sensory studies, latency is mildly delayed in both radial nerves as well as velocity is borderline in the right radial nerve and amplitude is decreased in the left ulnar nerve.

CONCLUSION:
Bilateral compression of ulnar nerves at elbows, worse on the left.
Do EMG to rule out cervical radiculopathies.
