# üè• Enhanced Medical PDF Analyzer - Usage Guide

## What's New: Two-Step Analysis Process

Your tool now uses a sophisticated **two-step analysis** that eliminates duplicate information and creates unified timelines.

### üîÑ How It Works

**Step 1: Structured Data Extraction**
- Each PDF is analyzed individually to extract structured JSON data
- Captures: patient info, medical encounters, diagnostic results, billing data
- Includes source quotes and quality flags for verification

**Step 2: Unified Synthesis**
- All JSON data is combined and cross-referenced
- Creates single chronological timeline across all documents
- Flags contradictions without resolving them (preserves accuracy)
- Generates professional legal analysis report

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   cd medical-pdf-analyzer
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Upload Multiple PDFs**
   - Upload 2-10 related medical documents
   - Can include: visit notes, imaging reports, billing records, legal docs

3. **Click "Analyze Documents"**
   - Watch real-time processing status
   - Step 1: Individual extraction (shows progress per file)
   - Step 2: Synthesis and cross-referencing

## üìä What to Expect in Output

### **Enhanced Report Structure:**
1. **Processing Status** - Shows which files completed successfully
2. **Unified Patient Timeline** - Chronological merger of all encounters
3. **Cross-Document Correlations** - How findings relate between documents
4. **Identified Contradictions** - Conflicts flagged for legal review
5. **Treatment Progression Analysis** - Evolution of care over time
6. **Billing Validation Summary** - Services vs documentation
7. **Quality Control Observations** - Documentation issues
8. **Technical Correlation Summary** - Counts of conflicts/progressions found

### **Key Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **No More Duplicate Patient Info** - Unified demographics section
- ‚úÖ **Single Chronological Timeline** - All encounters merged by date
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Document Verification** - Correlates findings between providers
- ‚úÖ **Contradiction Detection** - Flags inconsistencies for review
- ‚úÖ **Source Attribution** - Every finding cites source document

- **2-4 PDFs**: 2-4 minutes
- **5-8 PDFs**: 4-8 minutes
- **Processing appears slower** but produces much higher quality analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Accuracy Features

- **Exact Quote Extraction** - Medical findings include verbatim source text
- **Conservative Synthesis** - Flags contradictions rather than inventing explanations
- **Source Traceability** - Every claim cites originating document
- **Quality Validation** - Identifies missing data and documentation gaps

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Upload in logical order** (initial visit ‚Üí follow-ups ‚Üí imaging ‚Üí billing)
2. **Include diverse document types** for better cross-referencing
3. **Review contradiction flags carefully** - these often contain key legal insights
4. **Use source citations** to verify claims against original documents

The enhanced tool transforms your workflow from simple PDF reading to professional medical-legal case analysis with verifiable accuracy.
